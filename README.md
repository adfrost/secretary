# secretary

The goal for this project, in addition to automating the process of creating a meeting minutes boiler plate based on attendance, is to teach me classes as well as to experience a project from start to completion, which is by far more valuble than the few minutes this saves me every week manually adding information to the template document i currently use

the current goals for this project are:

- [X] Generate boilerplate meeting minutes template using the python docx library
- [ ] Integrate Google Sheets API to additionally add members present to the .docx file, based on a master Google Sheets file for attendance 
- [ ] Automatically uploaded to the Google Drive as a PDF
- [ ] Lots of error checking
- [ ] Have fun


###ambitious goals
- [ ] Host SQL database of current members, officers and the members that hold them
- [ ] Web scraper to scrape the portal for data listed above to update local SQL DB (in case of change in position)
- [ ] create as an executable for next secretary to use
